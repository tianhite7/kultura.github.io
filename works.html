              Drawing from historical records, archival photographs, and oral histories from the Lake Macquarie region,
              Kultura Collectiva
              transforms these fragments of memory into immersive animated visualisations.
              Illustrations by Dias Prabu have been brought to life through animation by Latu Arifan, resulting in a
              dynamic interplay
              of vivid colour and fluid form.
              At the heart of the composition are delicate line drawings based on historical photographs of Lake
              Macquarie’s residents. Woven throughout the work, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vessels serve as carriers
              of memory, transporting archival imagery and evoking the passage of time.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Theatre of Memories not only preserves the lived experiences of the region’s
              communities but reinterprets
              them in ways that feel tactile, fluid, and deeply resonant. Much like the batik process itself—where dye
              and wax interact to create evolving forms—the exhibition invites audiences into a world where memory is
              not static but alive, shifting and transforming before their eyes.

              Presented within the 360-degree projection cube at MAP mima, the exhibition envelops visitors in an
              immersive environment of storytelling and cultural reflection. Voices from the past echo through animated
              landscapes, creating an experience that is both deeply personal and profoundly collective—a theatre in
              which history is performed, remembered, and reimagined.

              The evocative soundscape, composed by Jaeko Siena, further enhances the sensory experience, with Siena
              also delivering a live performance on opening night.

              One of Kultura Collectiva’s key objectives is to counteract cultural amnesia by bringing historical
              stories into modern artistic discourse.</p>

              During a 50-day residency in Tokoname, Japan, we explored new visual elements and integrated them with our
              creative perspectives. Our works capture the dynamics of cultural encounters, uncover hidden narratives,
              and showcase the beauty in diversity.
              For us, art is a medium for dialogue, expression, and transformation. Kultura Collectiva aims to bring
              Indonesia's stories to the global stage through honest and meaningful creations.

            A site-specific research and artworks by Dewi Buki about the story of the woman ulos weavers
            from Toba, North Sumatra who has a dedication to preserve and protect the cultural inheritance
            from Toba Lake, Indonesia. The research that got many attentions not just from Indonesia but
            also Australia. Dewi and her team just recently got a special recognition through an art exhibition
            and workshop at The Australian Tapestry Workshop (ATW) in South Melbourne, Australia this
            August 2024. She worked with three ulos weavers and one particular woven artist from
            Yogyakarta. For almost 8 years, Dewi focused on her research about the continuation of
            traditional ulos from Batak through anthropological photography works. We can see her works
            on her previous solo show at Salihara Gallery Jakarta in 2022 as well.

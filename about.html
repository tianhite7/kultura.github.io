      <p class="hero-text" style="margin-top:12px;">
       Kultura Collectiva is an artists collective based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia since 2020 and founded by Dias
        Prabu, who is a visual artist, muralist, drawing batik artist. At the beginning, Kultura Collectiva was a
        personal art project worked on by Dias Prabu called Kultura Project from 2017. This project was focused on
        painting and mural production programs based on maritime culture and narratives around Indonesian ocean which
        had a long history of spice trading and diverse traditions such as around the Natuna Islands, Selayar Islands,
        Aceh and Kalimantan. Then, Prabu decided to opened and expand the Kultura Project networks through collaborative
        platform and multidisciplinary art-form programs in 2020 then named it as Kultura Collectiva.
      </p>
      <p class="hero-text"> Kultura Collectiva is combining diverse of elements of arts, culture, traditions, naratives,
        including socio-historical
        context based on Indonesian Archipelago/Nusantara within contemporary art approaches. The essential part of
        this collective is being active to push the boundaries of to create an immersive, site-specific, participatory
        art
        works through collaborative approach with diverse arts disciplines like photography, film-making, performing
        art,
        music, fashion, or even craft. Moreover, Kultura Collectiva are also working with the local artists including

          <p class="section-text">
            There are three stages in the working process of how Kultura Collectiva make their works:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="hero-text">
        <b>
          Stage One:
        </b>
        Conduct research on local history. Locate and identify historical photographs. Read through
        historical accounts and materials such as literatures, books, websites and journals. Create a timeline of
        significant events. Speak with local historians and with local youth to gain different perspectives on local
        histories. Collate stories and images that can be interpreted through hand-drawn batik works, music
        collaborations, performace arts, murals, film, fine art and documentary photography.
      <p class="hero-text"><b>
          Stage Two:
        </b>
        A collaborative project from different art disciplines such as batik works with performance art, mural
        works with video art, photography with documentary film and ethnic music compositions with EDM
        music or even contemporary batik with the fashion project. The aim of this collaborations is to find a
        different perspective of how to make a variation, possibility, experimentations, re-imagination and re-
        interpretation.</p>

      <p class="hero-text"><b>Stage Three:</b>

        Create the artworks then exhibit it into an art exhibition, art show, art workshops, art teaching, site-
        specific works and collaboration, etc.

        Kultura Collectiva always improves every project to get maximum results that can connect the synergy of
        the three stages. As a collective art team that has been running for the past 4 years, Kultura Collectiva
        wants to continue providing art experiences to the community, students and the younger generation. The
        culture and traditions of the past that have been taught by our ancestors through our teachers in terms of
        art have also become a valuable lesson to remain in harmony with today's pop culture and for the future.
        Therefore, the historical foundations of past cultures from all of the world for us are like a land that should
        be preserved (through art). In the end, the continuity of life will always be balanced with art that still cares
        about culture, local wisdom and togetherness that can be enjoyed by all groups inclusively for the
        generations in the future. Below are examples of some of the works produced by Kultura Collectiva over the
        past 4 years. The works are produced in the form of solo exhibitions, collaborative art, educational art
        projects in the form of workshops and short classes, etc. </p>
      </p>
      <p class="hero-text" style="margin-top:10px;">
        Our practice moves between three gestures: <em>recording</em> (seeing and listening), <em>processing</em>
        (editing, arranging, presenting), and <em>responding</em> (inviting new conversations). Projects tend to be born
        at
        the intersection of these gestures.

            Dias Prabu (born 1987) is a multidisciplinary artist, painter, and muralist living and working in
            Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He completed his master's degree at the Indonesian Institute of the Arts in
            Yogyakarta in 2012 and rose to national prominence after winning a national mural competition
            initiated by the National Gallery of Indonesia in 2014 and becoming a finalist in various
            prestigious art competitions, including the UOB Painting of the Year in 2015. His artistic practice
            encompasses paintings, drawings, murals, installations, and batik drawing, exploring diverse
            materials such as acrylic paint, spray paint, textile dyes, charcoal, and found objects applied to
            fabric, canvas, and large-scale installations to convey visual complexity and narrative perspective. </p>
          <p class="card-text">His previous solo exhibition was held at Artspace Mackay, Queensland,
            Australia, and he was selected as one of the artists in the Indian Ocean Craft Triennial (IOTA24) in
            Perth, and completed the AiR Touch! Tokoname residency program in Tokoname, Aichi
            Prefecture, Japan. Dias is currently developing a new batik installation for a 2025 exhibition and
            preparing collaborative projects with his collective for a 2026 European tour, including in the
            Netherlands and Ireland, with a spirit of material exploration, interdisciplinary collaboration, and
            curiosity that continues to push the boundaries of his artistic practice. </p>

          <div class="card-meta">Photography & archives</div>
          <p class="card-text">
            Dewi Sartika Bukit is a photographer whose practice is rooted in location-based
            anthropological research, focusing on the Toba Batak ulos tradition in the Lake Toba region of
            North Sumatra. For a decade, she has worked intensively with female ulos weavers, using
            photography as a medium to record and interpret the relationships between the body, work,
            memory, and cultural heritage that are increasingly marginalized by industrial production. Her
            projects position ulos not merely as a visual object, but as a marker of life cycles, collective
            identity, and ancestral knowledge that live on in the community's daily lives. This approach is
            evident in her solo exhibition at Galeri Salihara, Jakarta (2022), and international recognition
            through an exhibition and workshop at The Australian Tapestry Workshop (ATW), Melbourne,
            in 2024.

          <p class="card-text">
            Jaeko Siena, was born in Bandar Lampung on June 7, 1989. He
            graduated from the Indonesian Institute of the Arts (ISI) Yogyakarta (2011–2016) with a degree in
            ethnomusicology, focusing on ethnic music creation. He works as a composer, arranger, and
            ethnic performer for both personal and commercial projects, with an artistic practice emphasizing
            the exploration of ethnic flute and ethnic percussion. In various interdisciplinary collaborations,
            Jaeko often serves as an ethnic music director. Outside of music, he has also developed a practice as
            a video maker, handling video clip production from shooting to editing, both for his own work and
            for clients.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Jaeko's career spans a wide range of national and international stages, with appearances
            at various
            festivals and arts forums in the United States, Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Thailand,
            Malaysia, Singapore, Kazakhstan, and Indonesia. Domestically, he held the solo concert Samirana
            (2024), performed at Jazz Gunung Bromo and Indonesia Fashion Week, and was involved in various
            theater productions and arts festivals. He is widely recognized as the Ethnic Music Director for Alffy
            Rev's projects, including Wonderland Indonesia 1 and 2, as well as various commercial musical
            works and live performances. Jaeko also has experience as a talempong and suling session player
            with Dewa Budjana. Through music, he views tradition as a living, moving knowledge—not a static
            form—that can be reinterpreted to bridge the ethnic roots of the archipelago with global contexts
            and contemporary expressions.</p>

          <div class="card-title">Abdi Karya</div>
          <div class="card-meta">Multidisciplinary artist, Programmer, and Curator</div>
          <p class="card-text">
            Abdi Karya's artistic practice is deeply rooted in traditional Indonesian culture, particularly Bugis-
            Makassar in South Sulawesi, integrating philosophy, mythology, and custom into his choreographic,
            theatrical works, performances, and installations. One of his primary sources is I La Galigo, a 13th-
            century epic that tells the origins of the Bugis people and remains alive in the daily practices of
            traditional families. For Abdi, family traditions and narratives are not artifacts of the past, but rather
            dynamic perspectives for interpreting contemporary realities. Since 2001, Abdi has worked with
            sarongs, initially as costumes and stage elements in theater and dance productions. His encounters
            with traditional elders and cultural leaders in Sulawesi opened new awareness of the potential of the
            sarong as an artistic medium. Since then, he has continued to explore textiles as a bridge between
            various layers of social issues, memories, and narratives. He interprets the sarong, a crucial element of
            the culture, as a “second body” for the body, a metaphor for the human relationship with time, space,
            circumstances, and the cycle of life. In his practice, Abdi works as an independent artist in South
            Sulawesi and beyond. Later in Yogyakarta, he is being part of the collective Kultura Collectiva and
            various arts networks within Indonesia, Australia and Nordic nation.</p>
          <p class="card-text">For over a decade, Abdi has also developed a long-term collaboration with Aboriginal
            artists from
            Northern Australia to explore the shared history of Makassans and Yolŋu peoples through the trade of
            sea cucumber in 1600-1900's. Through storytelling, performance, and ritual, this collaboration
            revitalizes cultural continuities across regions. For Abdi, contemporary art is a crucial medium for
            bridging cultures, reactivating forgotten narratives, and affirming the importance of cross-cultural
            dialogue rooted in memory, indigenous knowledge, and the continuity of tradition in a changing world.</p>

            Riki uses a gum oil printing process, developing the exploration and experimentation of his uni final
            project with the same technique. He is drawn to its inherent characteristic similarities to faded old
            photographs: grainy textures, partial focus, and also the human imperfections we can see in the traces of
            brushstrokes. Images emerge from the paper like half-remembered dreams, resisting sharp clarity evoking the
            subjective nature of memory.</p>
